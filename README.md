# Facial Expression Recognition Project

This project is focused on facial expression recognition using deep learning. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify facial expressions into 7 categories. The dataset used is the FER-2013 dataset, which is available on Kaggle. The project aims to detect human facial emotions for applications in areas such as human-computer interaction, healthcare, and security.

## Features

- **Facial Expression Classification**: The model can predict one of the following emotions:
  - Anger
  - Disgust
  - Fear
  - Happy
  - Sad
  - Surprise
  - Neutral
  
- **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve the model's performance.

- **Model**: A deep learning CNN model with multiple convolutional layers and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing and handling image arrays.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling CSV files.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting training curves.
- **Streamlit**: For deploying the model as a web application.
- **scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning utilities (e.g., metrics, preprocessing).
